# practice
git remote add origin (respoitarylink) #to link local to remote
git push -u origin master       #all changes everthing to that respotary

# now for local 

git init #to initiliage that we will use all that things
git status #to check anythig need to commit or not
git add #to add things in a git res
git commit -m #to confirm a change after everything also message there
git log #to see all changes
git rm --cached -r .  #to remove before commit
git checkout #to undo before commiting the file in
git clone (link of git res) #to clone it on ur local

make a .gitignore folder in which write the files that you don't want to commit while doing all
